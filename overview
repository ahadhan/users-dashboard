                OverView of Website.
Creating a website which contains users data/profile in the form of table.
It will have a see more ... option along with every individual user on table.
That see more ... option will open to new page that will have that user's posts.
These posts will contain its own comments and other interactions.


                Plan to develop it 
All the data will be fetched/get from Jsonplaceholder. 
Firstly create a header with Navbar. 
Than a Table that contains whole users name, email address and etc. and a see more button at the end of table.
Than there will be final footer at bottom. 
The see more.. button will redirect user to new page which will containe that user posts.
These posts contains comments and interactions. 

First I select Theme color for website. 
Than font family. 
Than I will use bootstrap for css. 
and in the last when UI get complete I will add functionality through JS.
